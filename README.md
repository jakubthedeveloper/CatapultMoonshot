# Catapult moonshot

This project is a game for game jam [Game Off 2020 @ itch.io](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2020).


> The theme for this year’s Game Off is MOONSHOT.
>
> moonshot – noun
>
> an extremely ambitious and innovative project
> the act of launching a spacecraft to the moon
> a hit or thrown ball that travels a great distance with a high trajectory

My interpretation of the theme is a game in which you send astronaut to the moon with... a catapult :)
